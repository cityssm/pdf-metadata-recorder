Staff is seeking Council approval of the tender recommendation.  BACKGROUND  The tender was publicly advertised and tender documents forwarded to all firms on our bidders list. A public opening of the tender was held February 19, 2020 with the Deputy City Clerk in attendance.  ANALYSIS  The tenders received have been thoroughly evaluated and reviewed, taking into consideration   pit   locations,   job   requirement   locations,   and   prices,   with   the Superintendent, and Director of Public Works.   We have determined that issuing a Standing Order to each firm, and using the different pit locations with reference to the job site location, along with the lowest tendered price, will best suit the construction needs of Public Works.  Also included on the summary is the pricing submitted by the sole supplier for alternative granular products for which there is a need in certain construction applications.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  Funding for the purchase of various Granular Materials as required will be drawn from various Construction Accounts. During 2020 Budget deliberations, Council   approved funding in the amount of $86,500 for Granular Materials.

Eng, Director of Public Works  DEPARTMENT:   Public Works and Engineering Services  RE:   Public Works Operational Delays Due to COVID - 19  ________________________________________________________________  PURPOSE  The purpose of this report is to inform Council of a number of operational delays this Spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  BACKGROUND  Traditionally, Public Works have a number of services which begin throughout the upcoming months which will be delayed due to the current pandemic.  ANALYSIS  Please find below the dates impacted and any foreseeable issues or timeline adjustments to allow the service to initiate.  Waste Management  The HHW Depot was scheduled to open as of April 14 th , 2020. This will be delayed until May 11 th   or until advised. This facility requires public interaction and contractor service for transport and disposal. Anticipating two (2) weeks time for adequate set-up, training and announcements, a public notice will be provided.  The landfill was set to be open to the public on Saturdays commencing April 11 th , 2020. It is proposed that this opening be delayed until May 11 th   or until further advised. Currently, the landfill remains open to the public each weekday for the receipt of degrading household waste   –   deemed for essential use only. Residents should not be using the landfill services for construction waste or Spring cleaning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scheduling of the sixth day (ie. Saturdays) may occur once staffing levels are restored. Approximately, two (2) weeks public notice will be provided.  The collection of leaf and yard waste was also scheduled to begin as of Monday, May 4 th , 2020. This collection is planned to be delayed until the week of May 11 th , 2020 or until further notice. As this is dependent on sufficient staffing levels  Page 28 of 39 Public Works Operational Delays due to COVID-19 2020 04 06 Page   2.  in the Public Works Operations Division, it is planned that two (2) weeks public notice will be provided.  Parks Division  Pointe Des Chenes day-park and campground was planned to open to campers approximately May 16 th , 2020. The commissioning of the water system for the comfort stations is required prior to the opening date, originally planned for the first week of May. There are also operational improvements to the water system being designed, which will require a 4   –   6 week period of time at normal operational levels. Operational staff for Public Works and the PUC (Water Plant Operators) will do our best to attend to those matters required at this facility, however, it cannot be the priority of staff during the time of the pandemic. Staff will consider all of these needs, and will commit to a future announcement regarding the opening date.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  There are no predicted significant financial implications to those delays in the area of Waste Management. Communication with the Lions Club regarding the delay to the opening of the Pointe Des Chenes campground will be ongoing with the goal to minimize the financial implications to all users and those that benefit from this service.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  The focus of this report are operational matters and are not articulated in the Strategic Plan.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Resolved that the report of the Director of Public Works dated April 6 th , 2020 be received and that Council approve the delay in the start of waste management services including the HHW Depot, landfill Saturday service and leaf and yard waste collection in addition to the delay in the opening of the Pointe Des Chenes campground until further public announcement due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The project includes the reconstruction of Second Avenue from Second Line West to Connaught Avenue.  BACKGROUND  In the current Five Year Capital Road Reconstruction Plan, the reconstruction of Second Avenue is planned for 2020.  Tenders   received   for   Contract   2020-2E   were   opened   at   a   public   meeting Wednesday, March 18, 2020 in the Russ Ramsay Room of the Civic Centre. Present at the opening was Deputy City Clerk Maddison Zuppa as well as City staff and contractor representatives.  ANALYSIS  A total of four (4) tenders were received.   All tenders submitted were found to be complete.   The low tender of $1,533,045.51 (excluding HST) was received from Avery Construction Limited.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  When recoverable PUC costs are removed and non-recoverable HST are added,  the City’s cost to   complete this project is projected to be $1,244,615. This is above the allocation in the 2020 capital budget of $1,070,000.   When individual budget allocations are considered, the project is over the urban only allocation by $55,400, it is over the overall capital allocation by $115,251 and over the sanitary sewer budget by $3,964.  However, the projects all carry contingency allowances built into the contracts that often are not spent.   As subsequent tenders come in for the other projects, staff will monitor the 2020 Construction Program to ensure that they come in, on or near budget.   Staff will continue to keep Council informed.  Page 30 of 39 Second Avenue Reconstruction 2020 04 06 Page   2.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  This report is linked to the new infrastructure focus area of the strategic plan.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Resolved that the report of the Manager of Design and Transportation Engineering, dated 2020 04 06, concerning the reconstruction of Second Avenue, be received and the recommendation that Contract 2020-2E be awarded to Avery Construction Limited, be approved.

Page 32 of 39 A-1-20-Z   –   25 Donna Drive (1890714 Ontario Inc.) 2020 04 06 Page   2.  ANALYSIS  Given the current situation (COVID-19), it is recommended that this matter be deferred indefinitely.

Vezeau-Allen Seconder Councillor M. Bruni Whereas   in   Ontario,   over   85   percent   of   Indigenous   people   live   in municipalities; and Whereas the growing percentage of Indigenous people living in municipalities and the Friendship Centres that serve them participate in and contribute to municipal community life; and Whereas the Friendship Centres have existed in Ontario municipalities for over half a century and have vital roles to play in community development, social cohesion, and improving the quality of life for Indigenous people living in urban and rural areas; and Whereas the Friendship Centres receive their mandate from their communities and are inclusive of all Indigenous people; and Whereas municipal governments have a growing and critical role in human and social services and community development and many have shown leadership in working in partnership with Indigenous organizations; and Whereas the Truth and Reconciliation Commission defines reconciliation as “an ongoing process of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships”; and Whereas strengthening relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is essential to municipal governments, Friendship Centres, and communities across Ontario; and Whereas municipal governments play an important role in providing and delivering   valuable   programs   and   services   to   meet   the   needs   of   their residents, as well as being responsible, in all or some part, for over two hundred and eighty (280) pieces of provincial legislation that impact daily life of all who live in Ontario; and Whereas many municipal governments and Friendship Centres have taken up the responsibility to collaborate on a variety of initiatives that improve Indigenous quality of life and have had tangible community impacts; and Whereas municipal governments are on the front-lines working directly with all individuals   to   support   and   determine   social   determinants   of   health, demonstrating a notion of direct responsibility contributing to community wellbeing and prosperity; and Whereas the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) has developed the Indigenous Relations Task Force to advise the AMO Board of Directors on municipal-Indigenous relationship building; and Whereas the Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres (OFIFC) was founded in 1971 and works to support, advocate for and build the capacity of member Friendship Centres across Ontario; and Whereas the Friendship Centre Movement is the largest Indigenous service network in the province supporting the vibrant and quickly growing Indigenous population through programming, research, education, and policy advocacy; and Whereas AMO and OFIFC are partnering on a variety of initiatives to improve collaboration and information sharing amongst our membership, not limited to the work of the AMO-OFIFC Indigenous Relations Working Group and an AMO – OFIFC Memorandum of Understanding; and Whereas this declaration is a living document that municipal governments and Friendship Centres can sign onto or use as a framework for the development of local or regional declarations that can be addended to this declaration; Now Therefore Be it Resolve that the Council of the City of Sault Ste.

July 27, 2020 Special Council Agenda  Page 5 of 18 The Corporation of the  City of Sault Ste. Marie  C O U N C I L   R E P O R T  July 27, 2020  TO:   Mayor Christian Provenzano and Members of City Council  AUTHOR:   Rachel Tyczinski, City Clerk  DEPARTMENT:   Corporate Services  RE:   Procedure By-Law Amendment   –   Electronic Participation in Meetings  ________________________________________________________________  PURPOSE  The purpose of this report is to recommend an amendment to Procedure By-law 2013-100 to allow for continued electronic participation in open   and closed meetings of Council and its boards and committees after the provincial declared emergency ends.  BACKGROUND  On March 19, 2020 the Province enacted amendments to the   Municipal Act   to allow for electronic participation in Council (and board and committee) meetings during a period where an emergency has been declared to exist in all or part of a municipality under section 4.0 or 7.0.1 of the   Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act . Council accordingly passed By-law 2020-76 on March 23, 2020 to amend Procedure By-law 2013-100.  On July 8, 2020 the Province introduced Bill 197   COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act 2020   which amended a number of Acts, including the   Municipal Act . On July 21, 2020 the Bill received Royal Assent and the Province thereby amended section 238 of the   Municipal Act   to allow for electronic participation in Council (and board and committee) meetings on a go-forward basis (not only during an emergency).  The July 21, 2020 amendments also allow municipalities to provide for proxy voting by members of Council.  Both of these provisions are optional.  ANALYSIS  The Provincial emergency order currently in place expires on July 29, 2020. In order to allow electronic participation in Council (and board and committee) meetings beyond July 29, 2020 an amendment to Procedure By-law 2013-100 is required.  In order to provide as much flexibility as possible, it is recommended that the Procedure By-law be amended to allow electronic participation in open and closed  Page 6 of 18 Procedure By-law Amendment   –   Electronic Participation in Council Meetings 2020 07 27 Page   2.  meetings of Council (and its boards and committees) and that members who participate in open or closed meetings electronically be counted for purposes of quorum.  Council has the option to determine the extent to which members can participate electronically (i.e. whether all members may participate electronically, or whether some are still required to participate by being physically present in the Council Chamber); however, it is recommended that this option be explored during the next review of the Procedure By-law.  Similarly, it is recommended that Council not adopt amendments to allow proxy voting by members at this time, but to explore the option during the next review of the Procedure By-law.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  There are no financial implications.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  This is an administrative matter not articulated in the corporate Strategic Plan.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  The relevant By-law 2020-144 is listed under item 5 of the Agenda.

The Government has made changes to expand the authority for municipalities to amend  their procedure by - law to provide that electronic participation in open and closed  municipal meetings may count towards quorum beyond times when an emergency  declaration is   in place. Extending the ability for municipalities to hold electronic  meetings responds to feedback we have heard from municipalities that the ability to  participate electronically in municipal meetings during the past months has been  beneficial to contin ue the important work that municipalities do and has led to increased  engagement with members of the public.  In addition, the Government has also passed changes to the legislation to give  municipalities the authority to amend their procedure by - law to al low members of  council who are unable to attend a meeting to appoint a proxyholder to act on their  behalf, subject to certain limitations.  For more information on these amendments, please see the attached information  sheets.  Both initiatives are optional , and it is up to your municipality to decide whether to  provide for electronic participation in meetings and/or proxy appointments and what  arrangements are suitable for your municipality.

It does not include all details and does not take into  account local facts and circumstances. This document refers to or reflects laws and practices that are subject to change.  Municipalities   are responsible for making local decisions that are in compliance with the law such as applicable statutes  and regulations.   This document   applies only to those municipalities whose meeting rules are governed by the Municipal  Act, 2001.  This   document   replaces previous guidance released in March 2020 regarding electronic participation in municipal  meetings during emergencies .

Page 9 of 18 Overview  The province has made changes to the   Municipal Act   to allow me mbers of councils, committees  and   certain local   boards who participate in open and closed meetings electronically to be counted  for purposes of quorum (the minimum number of members needed to conduct business at a  meeting).  These provisions are   optional. M unicipalities   continue to have the flexibility to determine if they  wish to use these provisions and incorporate them in their individual procedure bylaws.  Municipalities may wish to review their procedure bylaws to determine whether to allow  members to pa rticipate in meetings electronically, and whether to take advantage of the new  provisions based on their local needs and circumstances.  What a municipality can do  A municipality can choose to hold a special meeting to amend their procedure bylaw to   allow  electronic participation. During this special meeting, members participating electronically can be  counted for the purposes of quorum.  Municipal councils, committees and boards can choose to amend their procedure bylaws to:  •   allow the use of electroni c participation at meetings  •   state whether members can participate in both open meeting and closed meetings  •   state whether members participating electronically count towards quorum  It is up to municipalities to determine:  •   whether to use these provisions  •   the   method of electronic participation  •   the extent to which members can participate electronically   (for example,   it is up to  municipalities   to decide whether   all council members   participate electronically   or  whether   some still participate   when physically presen t in council chambers)  Technology to use for electronic meetings  Municipalities, their boards and committees can choose the technology best suited to their local  circumstances so:  •   their members can participate electronically in decision - making  •   meetings can   be open   and accessible   to the public  Page 10 of 18 Municipalities may want to engage with peers who have electronic participation in place to find  out about best practices as they revise their procedure bylaws. Some municipalities may choose to  use teleconferences whil e others may use video conferencing.  Open meeting requirements  If a municipality chooses to amend their procedure bylaw to allow people to participate  electronically, meetings would still be required to follow existing meeting rules, including that the  mun icipality:  •   provides notice of meetings to the public  •   maintains meeting minutes  •   continues to hold meetings open to the public ( subject to certain exceptions )  The   Municipal Act   specifies requirements for open meetings   to ensure that municipal business is  conducted transparently, and with access for and in view of the public. There are limited  circumstances under the   Municipal Act   when municipal meetings can be conducted in closed  session.  Rules for local boards  Local b oards subject to the meeting rules in the   Municipal Act   include:  •   municipal service boards  •   transportation commissions  •   boards of health  •   planning boards  •   many other local boards and bodies  Some local boards may not be covered. For example, police services, lib rary and school boards  have different rules about their meetings, which are found in other legislation.  Municipalities are best positioned to determine whether a local entity is considered a local board.  If in doubt whether a local entity is covered under   these rules, municipalities can seek  independent legal advice regarding the status of local entities and whether these new provisions  would apply to them.

Page 13 of 18 Overview  The province is providing municipalities with the flexibility to choose to allow proxy votes for  municipal council   members   who are absent. This power helps ensure continuing representation of  constituents’ inte rest s   on municipal councils when a member is unable to attend in person due to ,  for example,   illness, a leave of absence, or the need to practice physical distancing.  Municipalities   that   wish to allow proxy voting   must   amend their procedure bylaws to allow a  member of council to appoint another member   of the same council   to act in their place when they  are absent .  Optional and Flexible  Allowing   proxy voting   is   optional and it is up to each municipality to determine whether to allow  proxies for council and under what circumstances.   If a municipal council chooses to allow proxy  voting, it is up to each member to decide whether they wish to appoint a member of tha t council  as a proxy or not if they are to be absent .  Municipalities have the flexibility to determine the scope and extent of proxy appointments  including , for example,   any local rules or limitations, the process for appointing or revoking a  proxy, and how proxyholders may participate in meetings.   M unicipalities may wish to consider:  •   h ow proxies may be established and revoked;  •   c ircumstances where proxies may or may not b e used;   and  •   h ow a proxyholder may participate in a meeting including voting, speaking, or asking  questions on behalf of the appointing member .  If a municipality chooses to allow proxy voting, it would be the role of the municipal clerk to  establish a proce ss for appointing and revoking proxies.   Municipalities may als o wish to consi der  addressing proxy voting in their code of conduct or other local policies to help ensure that votes  are   appropriately   cast and that the   local   process is followed.  Once a   proxy has been appointed, the appointing member c ould   revoke the proxy using the  process established by the municipal clerk.  Limitations  Limits to   the   proxy appointment   process   are set out in legislation . These include:  •   A proxy holder   cannot be   appoint ed   unless   they are a membe r of the same council as the  appointing member :  o   For   u pper - tier s , this means   that a proxy holder   has   to be a member of the same  upper - tier council   as the appointee ,   regardless of lower - tier membership ;  Page 14 of 18 •   A member cannot act as a   proxyholder for more than one other member of council at a  time;  •   An appointed proxy is   not counted when determining if a quorum is present ;  •   A member appointing a proxy shall notify the municipal clerk of the appointment in  accordance with a local   process established by the clerk;   and  •   When a recorded vote is taken, the clerk shall record the name and vote of every  proxyholder and the name of the member of council for whom the proxyholder is acting.  Council member   absence rules still   apply . This mean s that   a member’s   seat would become vacant  if they are absent from the meetings of council for three successive months without being  authorized to do so by a resolution of council .  Accountability and Transparency  Members   appointing   proxies or acting as pr oxyholders are required to follow existing  accountability and transparency requirements. For example, a member may not   appoint   a proxy  or serve as a proxyholder   on   a   matter   in   which they have   a pecuniary interest under the   Municipal  Conflict of   Interest Act .   Municipalities may also want to consider transparency measures such as:  •   c ommunicating   to the public   who has appointed a proxy and who is serving as a proxy ;  •   p ublishing meeting agendas in advance so   that   proxies can be appointed , if needed ,   and  potential conflicts of interest can be identified ;   and  •   a llowing members to participate electronically when not able to attend meetings in person  rather than   appointing   a proxy .  For more information about existing accountability and transparency requir ements, including the  Municip al   Conflict of Interest Act, codes of conduct and the role of the local integrity  commissioner, please see the   Municipal C o uncillor’s G uide .

Shoemaker  October 13, 2020 Council Agenda  Page 4 of 122 Seconder Councillor L. Dufour Whereas for many years businesses in Great Northern Road have been acquiring properties on Blake Avenue to widen their lots and provide access to their customers or visitors to an alternate exit onto a less congested street; and Whereas   neighbours   on   Blake   Avenue   have   been   concerned   that   if businesses from Great Northern Road gain access to Blake Avenue, it will cause safety concerns for pedestrians as Blake Avenue is a Class B road with ditches and without sidewalks; and Whereas in 2019, when discussing the request of a local business owner that fronts on Great Northern Road for access onto Blake Avenue, Council rejected the request of the business owner, believing that providing access onto Blake Avenue would be better to do when Blake Avenue was upgraded to Class A services; and Whereas Council has deferred the Sackville Road extension project and staff is currently undertaking a prioritization process for remaining deferred projects from the current Capital Transportation Plan; Now Therefore Be It Resolved that staff bring forward a plan for the upgrade Blake   Avenue   to   Class   A   services   to   be   considered   in   the   Capital Transportation Plan. 8.2.

BACKGROUND  At a Council meeting dated February 3, 2020 the following resolution was passed.  Best for Kids Transit Pilot Project  Moved by: Councillor R. Niro Seconded by: Councillor M. Shoemaker  Whereas it is the objective of The Best For Kids Committee \"to encourage and promote the City of Sault Ste, Marie's efforts to put children first\"; and  Whereas it is the Committee's vision \"that Sault Ste. Marie will be a community that puts children first by understanding and investing in healthy childhood development to improve outcomes for all children\"; and  Whereas the City and the Committee are committed to fostering a community that has an extraordinary quality of lífe for children and their families; and  Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has many opportunities for children to be involved in recreational activities such as the Splash Pad, the Pump Track, the Manzo Pool, the Greco Pool, and the Skateboard Park; and  Whereas all of these recreational opportunities are important in the development of healthy children and their quality of life; and  Page 35 of 122 Best for Kids Transit Pilot Update 2020 10 13 Page 2.  Whereas it may be difficult for some children to access any of these recreational opportunities because of lack of transportation or its affordability;  Now Therefore Be lt Resolved that Community Development and Enterprise Services be requested to investigate the feasibility of a pilot project to run from June 27,2020 to September 6,2020, whereby Transit Services would provide free bus rides on weekends to all children and their parents who would like to attend any of the recreational facilities listed above and report back to Council.  Furthermore at a Council meeting dated March 9, 2020 the following resolution was passed.  Resolved that the report of the Director of Community Services dated 2020 03 09 concerning Best for Kids Transit Pilot Project be accepted and that a pilot project to provide free Transit for a responsible adult to accompany children to access the Splash Pad, Pump Track, Manzo Pool, Greco Pool and Skateboard Park between June 27, 2020 and September 6, 2020 be approved and results reported back to Council.  ANALYSIS  The pilot was scheduled to run from June 27 through to Sept 6, 2020. As a result of COVID-19 transit fare collection was forgone between March 19, 2020 to July 13, 2020 thus creating a delay to the true start date of the pilot. Therefore resulting in no statistics between June 27 to July 13, 2020.  In addition, ridership during this timeframe was below 50% of historical ridership as indicated in the table for reason stated.  Month   2019 Ridership   2020 Ridership   % of 2019  June 2020   145,232   46,809   32.23%  July 2020   145,184   58,434   40.25%  August 2020   137,519   64,193   46.68%  The stats for the pilot are significantly low and are not a true representation of would have occurred likely under normal circumstances. It is also highly likely that there were rides to the locations from pass users participating in the Social Services pass program thus contributing to lower requirements for free transit service to the identified locations.  In addition, monthly, 92 day and four (4) month semester passes were extended once fares resumed prorated accordingly further impacting pilot statistics. Transit Services supports this strong initiative for the Community and is recommending to  Page 36 of 122 Best for Kids Transit Pilot Update 2020 10 13 Page 3.  Council that the program be extended for one (1) more year in order to collect more data and will report back to Council. Staff is hopeful moving forward operations will return to more of the norm thus having a lower impact on operating results in 2021 and more reflective results will transpire.   The   initiative   is based on the idea that  transit   is open to the whole community and further   support s   individuals   that have  barriers in accessing community facilities . The   initiative   promote s   utilizing outdoor  spaces   leading to a healthy active living lifestyle.  Ongoing benefits are as follows:     Ease access for families to the city facilities that they may otherwise not be able to access     Provide   recreational   activities   to   children   which   is   key   in   healthy development     Improve the quality of life for these families  The process entails a passenger with a child(ren) boarding the bus, and stating where they are heading. The Operator does not charge the family member(s) accompanying and KEY ’S   in the appropriate number of individuals boarding the bus. Tacking is simple as completing the following:     For an adult riding free to a location below hit KEY 4     For any child riding free with an adult to a location below hit KEY D  The program will continue to service to the areas noted below.  o   Splash Pad  o   John Rhodes Community Centre Pool  o   Skateboard Track  o   Pump Track  o   Manzo Pool  o   Greco Pool  The Best for Kids Committee have been advised that results of the pilot were low based on the impacts of COVID and support staff gathering more data with an extension.   City   staff   are   r ecommending to   extend the pilot   and   to run from   the last  weekend   in   June   the   day   after   Labour   Day   in   September .   Corporate  Communications   will   promote   the   service   option   using   social   media   to  communicate this to the public.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  The financial impact to Transit operations was nominal given the number of participants for the pilot. It is anticipated that this one (1) year extension will not a  Page 37 of 122 Best for Kids Transit Pilot Update 2020 10 13 Page 4.  have a significant impact on forgone revenue (less than $1,000) and can be accommodated easily within the existing budget.  STRATEGIC   PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  The recommendation supports the focus area of the Community Strategic Plan for 2016-2020 in a number of ways.     Within the Service Delivery focus area, it continues to assist in delivering excellent customer service to citizens.     Additionally it supports the focus area of infrastructure, as it will assist in Maintaining Existing Infrastructure.     Under Quality of Life area the action promotes Quality of Life Advantages.     Community Development & Partnerships, it creates Social and Economic Activity.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Resolved that the report of the Director, Community Services   –   Community Development & Enterprise Services dated 2020 10 13 be received.  Furthermore, that Council approve the Best for Kids Transit program be extended for one (1) more year in order to collect more data and report back to Council.

BACKGROUND  This grader was sent to Toromont CAT (sole sourced due to lease requirements) with the main concern being a bent turntable as a result of winter maintenance activities. After initial assessment, it was determined the following repairs were also required: front crankshaft seal, front axle shaft, hoses required replacement as well as a hydraulic leak on the wing required addressing and a broken step was repaired.  ANALYSIS  Initially, it was estimated that the repair would be of a value within the approval limit of staff, however as the additional repair requirements were uncovered the final cost totalled $98,952.33 (not including HST). As the total has exceeded the staff approval limit, Council approval is required.  In order to prevent this type of turntable damage in the future, the Public Works 2020 equipment tender was modified to include the requirement of impact protection including a heavy-duty dual input circle drive gear box with a slip clutch.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  The total expense of $98,952.33 plus $12,863.80 HST for a total of $111,816.13 is due to Toromont CAT. The repairs will be funded through Public Works operational accounts associated with Winter Control.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  This is an operational item not articulated in the Corporate Strategic Plan.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Page 44 of 122 Grader Repair   –   Approval of Costs 2020 10 13 Page   2.

Eng., Land Development and Environmental Engineer  DEPARTMENT:   Public Works and Engineering Services  RE:   Landfill Operations and Monitoring 2019   –   Environmental Monitoring Committee  ________________________________________________________________  PURPOSE  The purpose of this report is to fulfill Condition 6(b) of By-law 2014-215 related to the Landfill Environmental Monitoring Committee (EMC), which requires an annual Council report following the submission of the Landfill Operations and Monitoring reports to the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP).  BACKGROUND  The EMC is the formal point of contact with the public for the landfill operations, as mandated under the Certificate of Approval.   The Committee consists of four members of the public, one Councillor, the MECP, and staff. The Committee was originally established under By-law 89-174, which was repealed and replaced through By-law 2004-215.  The report will summarize the conclusions and recommendations of the annual 2019 operations and monitoring reports. The reports include but are not limited to, waste quantities and site capacity, leachate collection system information, and monitoring details related to ground water quality, surface water quality, and methane   gas.   Copies   are   available   in   the   Engineering   Department   if   any Councillor wishes to review them.  ANALYSIS  Site Development and Operations Report 2018 Municipal Landfill Waste Quantities and Site Capacity  Approximately 107,847 tonnes of waste was received at the landfill in 2019.   Of this value 40% was landfilled, and 58% was used as cover or stockpiled for future use, and 2% was diverted.   Based on the 5-year average disposal rate, there is capacity for approximately 6.5 years.  Page 46 of 122 Landfill Operations and Monitoring 2020 10 13 Page 2  Leachate Collection System  A leachate collection system has been operating at the landfill since 1992.   It consists of a gravity collection system along the south boundary and a purge well system on the western boundary.   As part of the 2006 Canon Creek relocation project, the gravity leachate collector system was expanded along the old creek alignment in the southeast corner.   The system is designed to intercept leachate before it leaves the site and divert it for treatment.  A western contaminant plume was detected several years back, which prompted increased emphasis on purge well maintenance to ensure continuous operation of the wells.   Presently, there are nine purge wells in operation.   The system continues to be maintained, operated, and monitored with vigilance, and remains effective, however, it has limitations.  In 2008 a contaminant attenuation zone (CAZ) was approved through the MECP.  While the CAZ doesn’t expand the landfill footprint, it moved the compliance  boundary westerly.  Odour Control  Council approved the construction of 24 passive landfill gas vent flares in 2004 with an additional six passive flares in 2007.   Due to a landfill gas regulation that was implemented in 2008, an active landfill gas system was constructed to meet the new requirements. The system was operational in 2010.  Eleven (11) odour complaints were received in 2019. It is believed that the landfill gas system has been effective in mitigating off-site odours, however, as disposal quantities decline, sludge disposal becomes more challenging.   The proposed biosolids management facility is expected to have a positive impact on odours.  Municipal Landfill Site Monitoring Report 2019  The monitoring report provides the results of the groundwater, surface water and landfill gas monitoring program, with the purpose of:     Monitoring the quality of groundwater and surface water;     Assessing the ability of the engineered controls and natural environment to attenuate contamination from the landfill site;     Establishing whether concentrations of targeted chemical parameters in the groundwater and surface water exceed MECP criteria;     Predicting future movement of contaminants and compliance; and     Ensuring safety within the buildings at the site as it relates to landfill gas.  Conclusions and Recommendations of Monitoring Report  Ground Water Quality  A system of monitoring wells is sampled regularly to determine the quality of groundwater on and off the site in the vicinity of the landfill. The program for 2019 consisted of 40 wells, and one maintenance hole.  Page 47 of 122 Landfill Operations and Monitoring 2020 10 13 Page 3  Engineered controls and natural attenuation processes including dilution are either reducing or keeping the leachate plume stationary along the eastern and southern property boundaries of the landfill. In 2019 the water quality in most of the western wells continues to perform as anticipated with no unusual upward trends or changes.   The contaminate attenuation zone which was established west of the landfill, assists with potential off-site regulatory compliance concerns in the area near the hydro corridor associated with a narrow plume. Purge well system continues to be effective but has limitations.   An additional purge well is planned for use when existing wells are not in use due to maintenance requirements.  Surface Water Quality  The relocation of Canon Creek away from the landfill in the fall of 2006 appears to have reduced leachate impacts on Canon Creek and the Root River.   Surface water is sampled and analyzed at five locations, which are upstream, adjacent to and downstream of the site.   The locations are sampled five times per year and results are compared to Provincial Water Quality Objectives. Generally, consistent results have been shown at two upstream locations.   Water quality has been variable at some of the other sampling locations. There were no exceedances of un-ionized ammonia from 2009-2017. Generally, surface water conditions have improved since 2007, as a result of the Canon Creek relocation.  Methane Gas  Since 2008, methane gas concentrations have been in the flammable range at one of the methane gas monitors.   The monitor is located east of the Maintenance Building.   A methane mitigation project was completed in 2010.   The system was installed in order to monitor indoor air quality, control ventilation and provide warning if there is a problem.   Signage is in place as an additional mitigative measure. Manual readings are also taken.  Two methane gas wells were removed due to construction near the household hazardous waste depot. Replacement wells were installed at an alternate location in 2018.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  There is no financial impact.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  This report is linked to the maintaining existing infrastructure component of the Strategic Plan.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Page 48 of 122 Landfill Operations and Monitoring 2020 10 13 Page 4  Resolved that the report of the Land Development and Environmental Engineer dated 2020 10 13 concerning the annual operations and monitoring reports for the municipal landfill be received as information.

BACKGROUND  The Licensee contacts the City annually to request permission to hold the Event at the Hub Trail Boardwalk. The Event will be held on November 11, 2020.

Marie  C O U N C I L   R E P O R T  October 13, 2020  TO:   Mayor Christian Provenzano and Members of City Council  AUTHOR:   Jonathan Kircal, Planner  DEPARTMENT:   Community Development and Enterprise Services  RE:   A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione)  ________________________________________________________________  PURPOSE  The applicant, Angelo Maione, is requesting an amendment to the Zoning By-law to permit a triplex on the subject property.  PROPOSED CHANGE  Rezone the subject property from Single-Detached Residential Zone (R2) to Single-Detached Residential Zone (R2.S) with the following special exceptions:  1.   Permit the existing triplex.  2.   Reduce the rear yard setback (west) from 10 metres to 5 metres for the existing triplex only.  3.   Permit the existing swimming pool, accessory buildings and structures to be located in an interior side yard.  4.   Permit an existing shed to be located in the required front yard.  5.   Permit an existing shed to be located within 0 metres of the main building, where 1 metre would otherwise be required.  6.   Permit parking to be located in the required exterior side yard and in the required front yard.  Subject Property     Location   –   The northwest corner of the Murton Avenue and Langdon Road intersection.     Approximate size   –   30m (99.5’) frontage along Murton Avenue and 35m (116’) frontage along Langdon Road, totalling 0.1ha (0.26ac) .     Present use   –   Triplex.     Owner   –   Angelo Maione.  BACKGROUND  No previous applications have been made for this property.  Page 57 of 122 A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione) 2020 10 13 Page   2.  ANALYSIS  Aerial imagery suggests that the original structure was a bungalow that later expanded to include an attached garage with a second storey addition. Although the home is orientated towards Langdon Road, by definition, the Zoning By-law indicates that the shorter lot line along Murton Avenue is the frontage.  The property has a detached garage on the north west corner of the property. Paved driveways access both streets. An above ground pool, deck, and a number of accessory structures exist on the lot. A fence separates neighbouring properties. The main building consists of a self-contained dwelling unit in the basement, ground floor and in the second storey addition above the attached garage. No exterior alterations are proposed.  The surrounding area largely consists of single-detached bungalows. Semis and 2 storey homes are interspersed within the area.  Conformity with the Official Plan (OP)  The Official Plan (OP) is a Municipal policy document that manages and directs the physical change and development of the community.   Council’s decision must  be consistent with the OP.  Schedule C (Land Use) of the Official Plan designates the property as Residential. The following policies support this application:  Housing  HO.1: Opportunities for a full range of housing types shall be provided to meet the present and expected needs of the community.  HO.2: Innovative and alternative residential development standards supporting affordable housing and compact urban form shall be  encouraged…  Residential  R.1: A mixture of housing types and diversity of ownership and tenure forms shall be encouraged in new development.  R.4: Small scale intensification may be permitted in all residential areas unless adequate supporting infrastructure is not available or significant physical constraints exist.  R.5: Small scale residential intensification may include, but not be limited to, rooming, boarding and lodging houses, apartments in houses, infill development and redevelopment.  Page 58 of 122 A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione) 2020 10 13 Page   3.  The property is located Wellhead Protection Area B (WHPA-B). A WHPA is the area around a wellhead that contributes source water to the Steelton Well. As per the Sault Ste. Marie Region Source Protection Plan, residential uses are not considered a significant threat. The proposed triplex is not impacted by the Clean Water Act or the policies contained within the approved Sault Ste. Marie Region Source Protection Plan.  The proposal is consistent with the Official Plan  Conformity with the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS)  The Provincial Policy Statement 2020 (PPS) provides policy direction on matters o f provincial interest related to land use planning and development. Council’s  decision must be consistent with the policies contained in the PPS. The proposed amendment has been reviewed against these policies and is consistent as follows:  Managing and Directing Land Use to Achieve Efficient and Resilient Development and Land Use Patterns  1.1.1 Healthy, liveable and safe communities are sustained by:  a) promoting efficient development and land use patterns which sustain the financial well-being of the Province and municipalities over the long term;  b) accommodating an appropriate affordable and market-based range and mix of residential types (including single-detached, additional residential units, multi-unit housing, affordable housing and housing for o lder persons)…;  e) promoting the integration of land use planning, growth management,  transit-supportive development, intensification and infrastructure planning to achieve cost-effective development patterns, optimization of transit  investments, and standards to minimize land consumption and servicing  costs;  Housing  1.4.3 Planning authorities shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing options and densities to meet projected market-based and affordable housing needs of current and future residents of the regional market area by:  c) directing the development of new housing towards locations where appropriate levels of infrastructure and public service facilities are or will be available to support current or will be available to support current and projected needs;  d) promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation and transit in areas where it exists or is to be developed;  Page 59 of 122 A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione) 2020 10 13 Page   4.  e) requiring transit-supportive development and prioritizing intensification,  including proximity to transit…  This proposal is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement.  Conformity with the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario (GPNO)  The Growth Plan for Northern Ontario 2011 (GPNO) establishes a framework for  managing growth in Northern Ontario. Council’s decision must either conform or  not conflict with the plan. The proposed amendment has been reviewed against the GPNO and is consistent as follows:  3.4.3 Municipalities are encouraged to support and promote healthy living by  providing for communities a range and mix of housing types…  4.3.3 Economic and service hubs shall maintain updated official plans and develop other supporting documents which include strategies for a) developi ng … an appropriate range of housing types … and providing easy  access to stores, services and recreational opportunities.  The proposal is consistent with the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario.  COMMENTS  The proposal is compatible with the character of the neighbourhood. The large lot size allows a front yard setback and streetscape that is congruent with the other properties along both of the abutting roads. The dwelling density, shape and general bulk of the main building and lot coverage are within a range that is appropriate for this single-detached residential neighbourhood. The hip styled roof on the second-storey addition is steep and appears lower than its true elevation. Privacy and shadow impacts are not anticipated. Parking is distributed onto both driveways and the property grounds are well maintained.  The yard to the west of the house is the rear yard by definition and as such, the property has a very limited rear yard. The requested variances to permit the existing swimming pool and accessory structures within the interior side yard are technical in nature and provide a practical solution that poses no neighbourhood impacts. These variances also reflect the existing conditions of the property; additional development is not being proposed. The interior portion of the property is well screened from the adjacent property and the street by a fence.  Given the property’s size and exposure onto two streets, site plan control is being  recommended to ensure the continued compatibility with neighbouring properties.  CONSULTATION  Public Comments  Page 60 of 122 A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione) 2020 10 13 Page   5.  Public notice was mailed out to property owners within 120 metres of the subject property. A neighbourhood meeting was not scheduled due to COVID-19 safety protocols. At the time of writing this report, no comments from the public were received by planning staff.  Application Circulation  No comment/objection: the Accessibility Advisory Committee, Community Development and Enterprise Services, Economic Development Corporation, Engineering Services, Fire Services, Legal Services, Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Municipal Heritage Committee, Public Works and the PUC, the Sault Ste. Marie Region Conservation Authority.  The Building Division states that upon approval of this application, all Ontario Building Code requirements must be met to formalize the existing units. A change of use permit will be required to legally convert the building to a triplex. Submission of a building design completed by a qualified designer will be required. The spatial separation between the house and existing detached garage will also need to be confirmed to determine if it meets Ontario Building Code requirements.  Spatial separation calculations will need to be provided for the house and existing detached garage to confirm they meet the requirements of 9.10.14. of the Ontario Building Code.  FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS  Approval of this application will not result in any incremental changes to municipal finances.  STRATEGIC PLAN / POLICY IMPACT  Approval of this application is not directly linked to any Strategic Directions contained within the Corporate Strategic Plan.  Summary  The applicant, Angelo Maione, is requesting an amendment to the Zoning By-law to legalize the existing triplex and a number of other variances relating to existing accessory structures on the subject property.  Provincial and municipal planning policy encourage infill and redevelopment that increase the availability of a variety of housing types and tenures for existing and future residents of the community. Locally, a number of converted dwellings offer affordable alternatives   without substantially altering the home’s original external  appearance or compatibility with the neighbourhood. This triplex exemplifies such development and represents a positive contribution to the neighbourhood.  Page 61 of 122 A-12-20-Z 312 Langdon Road (Maione) 2020 10 13 Page   6.  The triplex has existed since before the applicant purchased the property in 1989. No exterior alterations are proposed. The additional variances are largely technical in nature and needed due to limitations that are commonly associated with corner lots.  RECOMMENDATION  It is therefore recommended that Council take the following action:  Resolved that the Report of the Planner dated 10 13 2020 concerning Rezoning Application A-12-20-Z be received and that Council approve the application as follows:  Rezone the subject property from Single-Detached Residential Zone (R2) to Single-Detached Residential Zone (R2.S) with a special exception, subject to the following provisions:  1. Permit the existing triplex, in addition to the uses permitted in a Single- Detached Residential Zone (R2).  2. Reduce the rear yard setback (west) from 10 metres to 5 metres for the existing triplex only.  3. Permit the existing swimming pool, accessory buildings and structures to be located in an interior side yard.  4. Permit an existing shed to be located in the required front yard.  5. Permit an existing shed to be located within 0 metres of the main building, where 1 metre would otherwise be required.  6. Permit parking to be located in the required exterior side yard and in the required front yard.  And deem the subject property as an area of Site Plan Control.
